# Overview

Veritone is a leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and solutions. The company's proprietary operating system, aiWARETM, orchestrates an expanding ecosystem of machine learning models to transform audio, video and other data sources into actionable intelligence.

Some features in this endpoint are:

- Authentication
- Helpers to make GraphQL queries

To make a GraphQL query, you can do something like this:

```js
var res = app.endpoints.veritoneuser.gql.post(`
  mutation runEngineJob {
    createJob(
      input: {
        targetId: "102014611",
        tasks: [
          {
            engineId: "8081cc99-c6c2-49b0-ab59-c5901a503508"
          },
          {
            engineId: "insert-into-index"
          },
          {
            engineId: "thumbnail-generator"
          },
          {
            engineId: "mention-generate"
          }
        ]
      }
    )
    {
      id
    }
  }
`,`{}`);
```

Reference the [GraphQL API](https://docs.veritone.com/#/apis/using-graphql) for more information.

# Configuration

- You will need to create an account at Veritone
- Generate an API token as described [here](https://docs.veritone.com/#/apis/authentication)

## API Token
API token to access Veritone's services

# Quick start

GraphQL API allows you to do everything you need. You can make a GraphQL query like this:

```js
var res = app.endpoints.veritoneuser.gql.post(`
  mutation userLogin ($userName: String! $password: String!) {
                  userLogin(input: {userName: $userName password: $password}) {
                    token
                  }
                }
`,`
 {"userName": "jdoe@mycompany.com","password": "Password123"}
`);
```

# Javascript API

The Javascript API of the veritoneuser endpoint has three pieces:

- **HTTP requests**: These allow to make regular HTTP requests.
- **Shortcuts**: These are helpers to make HTTP request to the API in a more convenient way.
- **Additional Helpers**: These helpers provide additional features that facilitate or improves the endpoint usage in SLINGR.

## HTTP requests
You can make `POST` requests to the [veritoneuser API](API_URL_HERE) like this:
```javascript
var response = app.endpoints.veritoneuser.post('/v3/graphql')
```

Please take a look at the documentation of the [HTTP endpoint](https://github.com/slingr-stack/http-endpoint#javascript-api)
for more information about generic requests.

## Shortcuts

Instead of having to use the generic HTTP methods, you can (and should) make use of the helpers provided in the endpoint:

* API URL: '/v3/graphql'
* HTTP Method: 'POST'
```javascript
app.endpoints.veritoneuser.gql.post(query, variables)
```

## Flow Step

As an alternative option to using scripts, you can make use of Flows and Flow Steps specifically created for the endpoint:
